There once was a speedy Hare called Bunny who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, the Tortoise challenged him to a race. All the animals in the forest gathered to watch.

Bunny ran down the road for a while and then and paused to rest. He looked back at the tortoise and cried out, "How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?"

Bunny stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, "There is plenty of time to relax." The Tortoise walked and walked; never ever stopping until he came to the finish line.

The tortoise beat the Hare in a photo finish! The Hare then apologized for bragging and became great friends with the Tortoise. The two animals teamed up to help the rest of the forest animals run better, and they started the world's first running club.
